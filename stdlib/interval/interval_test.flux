// Three rules:
// 1. When you add a duration  to a time you expect all smaller units of time to remain the same
// 2. When you add a duration to a time you expect the unit being added to change by the amount specified.
// 3. When you cannot achieve rule 1 then follow rule 2.
// Examples:
// Adding a day you expect the time of day to be the same
// Adding a month you expect the day of the month and the time of day to be the same
//
// In cases where that is not possible follow rule 2.
// For example adding 1 month to Jan 31 the day of the month cannot be the same so use the last day of February.
// Using any days in march would violate rule 2 because it would increase the month unit by 2 even though you only added 1 month.
// Constant time lookup
// Mixed durations do not commute or assiosicate so when they are involved in the alegbra of determining a window they make the math hard/impossible.
// Therefore we have certain restrictions in order to make window lookup constant
//
// Possbile equations for window definitions:
//
//    Option 1
//       window_start_i = (epoch + offset) + every * i
//       window_stop_i  = window_start_i + period
//
//   Option 2
//       window_start_i = epoch + every * i + offset
//       window_stop_i  = epoch + every * i + period + offset
// Edge cases
// When you can't follow rule 1
// When the every duration is on the same order of magnitude as the gap in time
// i.e. group by 1h or 2h or 3h over day light savings change
// When a mixed time adjust things across boundaries
// When a period is negative
